# CHANGELOG

# 1.4.2

- Feature: Support overriding the resolver for `Absinthe.Relay.Connection` edge node fields. See [PR #99](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/99) for more details.

# 1.4.1

- Bug Fix: Fix issue with `:modern` flavor + ParseIDs middleware. See [PR #96](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/96) for more information.

# 1.4.0

- Feature: Support `null` values in `ParseIDs` middleware (passed through as `nil` args)
- Bug Fix: Support `null` values for `before` and `after` pagination arguments (expected by Relay Modern)

## 1.3.6
- Type Spec Fix: Relax type constraints around `Connection.from_query`

## 1.3.5

- Bug Fix: (Connection) Fix original issue with `from_query` where `has_next_page` wasn't correctly reported in some instances. We now request `limit + 1` records to determine if there's a next page (vs using a second count query), use the overage to determine if there are more records, and return `limit` records. See [PR #79](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/79).

## 1.3.4

- Enhancement: (Node) Better logging support when global ID generation fails due to
  a missing local ID in the source value. See [PR #77](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/77).
- Bug Fix: (Connection) Fix issue where `has_next_page` is reported as `true` incorrectly; when the number of records and limit are the same. See [PR #76](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/76).

## 1.3.3

- Bug Fix (Node): Fix regression with the `Absinthe.Relay.Node.ParseIDs` middleware when used in conjunction with
  the `Absinthe.Relay.Mutation` middleware. See [PR #73](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/73).
  for details.

## 1.3.2

- Enhancement (Node): `Absinthe.Relay.Node.ParseIDs` can now decode lists of IDs. See
  the module docs, [PR #69](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/69) for details.
- Bug Fix (Connection): Make `Absinthe.Connection.from_slice/2` more forgiving if a `nil`
  value is passed in as the `offset`. See [PR #70](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_relay/pull/70)
  for details.

## 1.3.1

- Enhancement (Node): `Absinthe.Relay.Node.ParseIDs` can now decode nested values! See
  the module docs for details.
- Enhancement (Node): Improved error message when node ids cannot be parsed at all.

## 1.3.0

- Breaking Change (Connection): The functions in the `Connection` module that produce connections
  now return `{:ok, connection}` or `{:error, reason}` as they do internal error handling
  of connection related arguments

- Enhancement (Node): Added `Absinthe.Relay.Node.ParseIDs` middleware. Use it instead of
  `Absinthe.Relay.Helpers.parsing_node_ids/2`, which will be removed in a future
  release.
- Enhancement (Node): Allow multiple possible node types when parsing node IDs.
  (Thanks, @avitex.)
- Bug Fix (Node): Handle errors when parsing multiple arguments for node IDs more
  gracefully. (Thanks to @avitex and @dpehrson.)
